    ### The Data:
    Myers and Briggs created their personality typology to help people discover their own strengths and gain a better understanding of how people are different.
    The Data used in the project contains a questainaire , whose answers are values are integers from -2 to 1.
    The data is used to predict the personality type of the test-taker.
